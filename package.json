  "description": "* Make a Scrabble word finder app with both a server and client. On the client,   the UI simply is a text input for your up-to-7 letters in your Scrabble rack,   and a button to send the letters to the server. * On the server side, efficiently find words which can be made with those   letters, within a big dictionary. Display the list of found words on the   client side. * like before, avoid googling. if you have to google, please note the fact. like   before, don't use frameworks on the client side, just plain vanilla JS and DOM   APIs.",
